# Project-Inventory-Management-
The main purpose of this project is to create a database for a service company to manage their project to control inventory trajectories and quantities to reduce costs, maximize returns, and increase the business value of the organizationâ€™s data assets.  Project Management services also strive to control the timing of inventory, the uncertainty of demand and supply availability, and overall economies of scale. The database that is to be created will contain records of the stores for the warehouse, suppliers providing the requirements, store contractors, and employees database with multi-dimensional background to function the overall operation and details of the suppliers.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112844365/208316532-c76a4df8-62b3-4454-9aa6-ba4dd6ca08e4.png)
